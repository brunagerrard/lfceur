    🏆 A Tribute to Liverpool Football Club 🏆
</h1>

## 👩‍💻 About Me.
Trying to figure out this whole web-developing thing, one step at a time.

## ℹ This Project.
This baby is my first Responsive Web Design project, meaning its layout *should* adapt to the screen it is displayed on, provided there are no [compatibility issues](#-Browser-Compatibility). I've been an enthusiastic Liverpool FC supporter for over 15 years now, and it's finally paying off 😅 so I believe I have earned the right to gloat and brag.

This web page is a tribute to Liverpool's european history, displaying information such as context, score and images of every Champions League/European Cup title ever won by the club. 

## 🚀 Tech & Frameworks.

✔[Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/)

✔[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

✔HTML5

## 💻 Browser Compatibility.
Designed for Google Chrome only, should work fine on both desktop and mobile.

## ⏭️ Up Next.
This page is a work in progress, and so it will be updated and expanded. Next tasks:

🖼️ add photo caption to the carousels
